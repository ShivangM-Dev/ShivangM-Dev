# Hey there! 👋

I'm **Shivang**, a **Full Stack Developer**.

I build end-to-end products — from clean UIs to scalable backends.

If a problem annoys me enough, I usually end up building a solution and shipping it.

### Tech Stack

**Frontend**

* React
* TypeScript
* Tailwind CSS
* Next.js

**Backend**

**Database & Infra**

* PostgreSQL / MongoDB

* Cloud deployments (Vercel / Render / AWS basics)

### Projects

I’ve built multiple public and private projects covering:

* Full-stack web apps
* API-first backends
* File processing & automation
* SaaS-style dashboards

Most projects focus on **real-world problems**, not tutorials.

---

### Philosophy

* Ship fast, then improve
* Simple > clever
* Code should be boring and predictable
* If it doesn’t scale, it’s broken

---

### Currently Learning

* System design
* Backend performance & scaling
* Better database modeling

---

### Fun Facts

* I prefer building over talking
* I like solving backend problems and polishing UI
* Debugging is half the job
