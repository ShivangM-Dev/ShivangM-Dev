Hey there! 👋
I’m **[Shivang](https://shivangmandal.vercel.app/)**, a **Full Stack Developer** based in India.

I design and build complete products — frontend to backend.

If a real problem shows up, chances are I’ll try to build a solution and ship it.

My main tech stack is React, TypeScript, Node.js, Fastify/Express, and PostgreSQL. My favorite tools are VS Code, GitHub, Postman, and Linux.

I’ve got a bunch of pinned projects, mostly focused on full‑stack apps and backend systems.

I’ve built multiple public projects, and even more private ones while experimenting and learning.


Fun Facts:

I prefer backend problems over UI polish

I like building things more than talking about them

Debugging is half the job

Hobbies: coding, gym, learning systems, football
